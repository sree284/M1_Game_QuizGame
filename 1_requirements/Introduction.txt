A quiz is a form of game or mind sport in which players attempt to answer questions correctly about a certain or variety of subjects.
Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, or skills.
Multiple Choice Quiz is a form of an objective assessment in which respondents are asked to select only correct answers from the choices offered as a list. 
The multiple choice format is most frequently used in educational testing, in market research, and in elections, when a person chooses between multiple candidates, parties, or policies.
Multiple choice items consist of a stem and several alternative answers. The stem is the openingâ€”a problem to be solved, a question asked, or an incomplete statement to be completed. 
The options are the possible answers that the examinee can choose from, with the correct answer called the key and the incorrect answers called distractors.
Only one answer may be keyed as correct.This contrasts with multiple response items in which more than one answer may be keyed as correct.
